# 6x4 Shift Schedule App

This application was developed to assist in the visualization and management of 6x4 shift schedules, displaying shifts, days off, and allowing daily notes.

## About the 6x4 Schedule

The 6x4 schedule is a shift system that organizes teams in work and rest cycles. In this application, teams are named from A to E, with the following patterns:

* **Teams A and B:** 4 mornings, 2 nights, and 4 days off.
* **Teams D and E:** 4 afternoons, 2 nights, and 4 days off.
* **Team C:** 2 mornings, 2 afternoons, 2 nights, and 4 days off.

## Current Version: 1.1.0

This is the first version of the application, with the following features:

* **Team Visualization:** Displays the teams (A to E) of the 6x4 schedule, their shifts, and days off according to the pattern described above.
* **Daily Notes:** Allows adding specific notes for each day.
* **Intuitive Interface:** Simple and easy-to-use design.

## Upcoming Features

We are working on improvements and new features for future versions:

* **Support for Other Schedules:** Addition of support for other schedules with different nomenclatures.
* **Calendar View:** Implementation of an interactive calendar with colors to represent the shifts of each team.
* **Performance Improvements:** Optimization of the application for better performance and speed.
* **Enhanced User Interface:** Design improvements for a better user experience.
